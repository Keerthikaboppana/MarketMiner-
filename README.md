This project implements the Apriori algorithm in Python for market basket analysis. The Apriori algorithm is a fundamental algorithm used for mining frequent itemsets and discovering associations between different items in large datasets, such as customer transactions. The algorithm generates association rules based on a minimum support and confidence level, allowing businesses to find relationships between items often bought together.
